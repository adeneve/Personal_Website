  <p class="heading"> About me </p>
  
  <p class="textBlock"> I am 23 years old, born and raised in California. I spent most of my early childhood and adolescence in Ventura County.
      I went to Westlake Highschool, where I gained interest in engineering and played for the school's doubles tennis team.
	  After highschool, I left Southern California to study at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
      UCSC sits on a large plot of land close to the shoreline and is split up into multiple colleges. At UCSC I was part of 
	  Crown College, the college focused on the sciences and engineering. In June of 2018, I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science
      in Computer Science. <br><br>
	  
	  As of now, I am living in Thousand Oaks, California.
	  <br><br>
	  Some hobbies of mine-
	  I like to hike, build and scrap computers, and cook.
