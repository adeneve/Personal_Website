  <p class="heading"> What am i doing?</p>

  <p class="textBlock"> I currently work at a software company called Marketscan that deals with the business of building software for the automotive industry.
          In summary, they constantly track and collect information like rebates, rates, lender policies, tax information, etc. and aggregate it to form a percise
          payment calculation engine. They sell their data and calculation engine in the form of an API, which can be accessed using the HTTP application protocol.
          My role is QA (or quality assurance), which involves testing (both automated and manual) software and working close with the dev team. My latest automated
          test pings most of the API methods and checks for basic functionality (e.g. status code and response format check); the script runs overnight and emails
          the test results for easier review. Overall this has been a great first experience in the tech industry.

    I am interested in eventually entering the IT & network engineering career field. Whats the difference between switches and routers? How do routing protocols work? What is going on in the Internet Service Provider
      network? Understanding low level computer communication is vital
      to many existing and widely used applications, and that is why I see so much value in it.
	  Most routers and switches used in the internet today are Cisco brand. So, it would make sense to understand how to work
	  with their devices if wanting to start a career in network engineering. Cisco offers a bunch of certifications ranging
	  from network security to data center configuration. But, their most universal certifications are the CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE (in order of merit).
	  I recently aquired my CCNA Routing and Switching cert, and am looking into a certification called the Network Security+, which focuses more in
    network security. <br><br>

    When I'm off work I cook, workout (I just started a fun 'spinning' or cycling class), play in a band, or play video games <br><br>
