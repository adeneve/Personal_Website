  <p class="heading"> What am i doing?</p>
  
  <p class="textBlock"> Right now I am trying to enter the IT & network engineering career field. After some thought
                        and a few months of retail work, I've decided that network engineering is the most interesting 
						to me. Whats the difference between switches and routers? How do routing protocols work? What is going on in the Internet Service Provider
						network? Understanding low level computer communication is vital 
						to many existing and widely used applications, and that is why I see so much value in it.

	  Most routers and switches used in the internet today are Cisco brand. So, it would make sense to understand how to work
	  with their devices if wanting to start a career in network engineering. Cisco offers a bunch of certifications ranging
	  from network security to data center configuration. But, their most universal certifications are the CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE (in order of merit).
	  They recently added the CCENT as a halfway milestone towards aquiring the CCNA due to the large amount of information covered in 
	  the CCNA. In Feburary of 2019, I aquired my CCENT, and am currently working to finish my CCNA. My work day consists of studying networking concepts,
	  applying to IT jobs, and helping my dad with some of his construction projects. <br><br>
